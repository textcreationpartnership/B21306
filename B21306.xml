            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREUPON his Real Estate of about 750 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">22 <hi>Oct.</hi> 36. <hi>Car.</hi> II.</note> and his Personal Estate of the Value of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> were Granted by His said Majesty, King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. to <hi>Wenth-Worth,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Roscommon,</hi> Captain <hi>Purcell,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Bourk;</hi> (which two last Persons were in the late Rebellion against His present Majesty in <hi>Ireland.</hi>)</p>
            <p>HIS present Majesty was graciously pleased to Sign a Bill,
<note place="margin">1689.</note> to pass into An Act of Parliament, for Reversing the said At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder, which was so far proceeded in, That it passed this Honourable House, and was twice Read in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and committed, but lost by a sudden Prorogation.</p>
            <p>THE Renewing the Prosecution of that Bill the Defendant was disabled from, by his being an Officer in His Majesty's Service in <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> where he was detained by the Wounds he received at the Siege of <hi>Limrick,</hi> and had one Brother kill'd by the <hi>Irish,</hi> and another (who was and still is an Officer in the same Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) very much wounded at the Siege of <hi>Limrick,</hi> and at the Battels of <hi>Aghrim</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Steinkirk</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS MAJESTY was pleased in Council upon the Reading a Report made by the late Attorney General (now Lord Chief Baron) to approve the same,
<note place="margin">3 <hi>March</hi> 1694.</note> and Order that the Attorney General should admit a <hi>Writ of Error</hi> to be brought by the now Defendant <hi>John Walcott,</hi> for Reversing the Attainder of his said late Father.</p>
            <p>WHEREUPON the Defendant brought his <hi>Writ of Error</hi> to Reverse the said Attainder,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Easter Term.</hi> 1694.</note> and was strenuously opposed therein by the Countess of <hi>Roscommon,</hi> upon the account of the said Grant made to the said late Earl of <hi>Roscommon</hi> her late Husband.</p>
            <p>THE Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Trinity Term,</hi> 13 <hi>June.</hi> 1696.</note> after having heard many Arguments made by the Lady <hi>Roscommons</hi> and the Defendant's Counsel on several Days, and perused a Multitude of Presidents for many Ages; all the Judges did agree, and did <hi>Seriatim,</hi> deliver their Opinions, That the said Judgment was Erroneous, and ordered the same to be Reversed.</p>
            <p>THE Lady <hi>Roscommon</hi> hath brought a <hi>Writ of Error</hi> in this Honourable House, to reverse the said Judgment of Reversal, and set up again the said Attainder.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>BƲT it is humbly hoped, That the Reversal of the said Attainder, shall be Affirmed for these Reasons.</head>
               <p>BECAUSE there are manifest Errors appearing in the said Indictment and Judgment.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               </p>
               <p>THE Judgment given upon the Defendant's Father,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> is various and different from all the Antient and Modern Presidents of Judgments given, in Cases of the like Nature.</p>
               <p>IF Judgment in Cases of High Treason be uncertain,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> then it is in the Power of the Judges either to mitigate the Sentence, or to inflict such Cruel Pains and Penalties as they please, and to introduce the Rack, Crucifixions, or any other strange Judgments.</p>
               <p>THE Lady <hi>Roscommon</hi> by her Case,
<note place="margin">Note,</note> seems to admit the Judgment to be Erroneous, but lays great stress on these three Allegations.</p>
               <p>THAT the Words which cause the Error were either Unwarrantably,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> or by Mistake, left out by the Clerk.</p>
               <p>THAT the Defendant's Father was Convicted for Compassing the Death of the King by Assassination.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               </p>
               <p>THAT it appears by Capt. <hi>Walcott</hi>'s Letter to Sir <hi>Leolin Jenkins,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> That he confessed his Guilt, and proffered to be a Spy upon his own Party.</p>
               <p>THOUGH in a Writ of Error Matters of Law only,
<note place="margin">Note,</note> ought to be considered, yet these Allegations are not without an Answer.</p>
               <p>AS to the Error being the Omission of the Clerk,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">ANSWER, </seg>
                  </label> that Answer may be given to almost all Errors in Records, which are the Omissions or Mistakes of Clerks or other Persons,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and Advantages thereof has always been allowed to be had, especially in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Life and Liberty; And the Writ of Error is to see if the Record as it is, be Erroneous.</p>
               <p>AS to the second,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> All the Witnesses against Capt. <hi>Walcott</hi> did acquit him as to the Assassination; And that he did declare, That he abhorr'd any such thing, and would be no way concerned in it, and at the very hour of Death denied that he was to have any hand in it.</p>
               <p>'TIS true,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> there was such a Letter to Sir <hi>Leolin Jenkins,</hi> in hopes by that means to have Saved his Life, and obtained Leave to pass into <hi>Holland,</hi> but he afterwards declined meeting Sir <hi>Leolin,</hi> nor did he give Information against any Body.</p>
               <p>THE Grant under which the Lady <hi>Roscommon</hi> claims,
<note place="margin">Note,</note> was purely Voluntary, and for no Consideration; and yet she hath Enjoyed the Estate under that Grant for Twelve Years, without so much as allowing Capt. <hi>Walcott's</hi> Poor Distressed Wife and Eight Children one Penny, or so much as a Bed to Lie on.</p>
               <p>THE Defendant humbly hopes Your Lordships, upon Consideration of his Case, will allow him that Favour His Majesty was Graciously pleased to design him, and the Law hath given him, and to Affirm the Judgment given in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> for Reversing the said Attainder.</p>
